## Overview

**What is SMART PLS?**

SMART PLSis a software with graphical user interface for variance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) using the partial least squares (PLS) path modeling method. Besides estimating path models with latent variables using the PLS-SEM algorithm, the software computes standard results assessment criteria (e.g., for the reflective and formative measurement models, the structural model, and the goodness of fit) and it supports additional statistical analyses (e.g., confirmatory tetrad analysis, importance-performance map analysis, segmentation, multigroup).  
  
Since SmartPLS is programmed in Java, it can be executed and run on different computer operating systems such as Windows and Mac.

## Features of SmartPLS  
> Advantages of SmartPLS  
 	
- Easy to control and analyze.  
- Introducing Smart PLS as one of the applications that can be used to generate research results  
- Produce a boxed and attractive model.  
- Have literature and network of support groups around the world.

## Ability of SmartPLS  
<img src = "logo.jpg" align = "right">
Inferential statistical analyzes were used in testing the study hypothesis based on a multivariate analysis of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) modeling using SmartPLS or more recognizable as PLS-SEM  
  
PLS-SEM is a complex statistical analysis technique that aims to maximize the explanation of variants in dependent variables (Hair, Ringle & Sarstedt, 2011)  
  
PLS-SEM also has the ability to perform graphical analysis of paths to show the direct effects of antecedent variables and indirect effects of the effects of intermediate variables. The PLS-SEM assessment shows the measurement of the measurement model and the structural model with regard to parameter stability.
